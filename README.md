# praw-test-project
Experimenting with PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper).

prawTests.py: Currently takes input for a subreddit to monitor and keywords to search for in all new commments on given subreddit. Returns in real time the name of the user who commented anything with given string of characters and the subreddit on which they made the comment (useful if subreddit to monitor is /r/all).
